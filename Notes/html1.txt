HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language

A simple Language made from elements.

What is Markup Language?
Ans: With the help of tags we give instruction to browser and they display it on web page.

Elements: (Tags)
Individual components for html document and every elements are self meaning...

Have Opening tage and closing tage (<style>....</style>)
Some elements have no closing tag like img, br, hr etc. (Only opening tags)

Nesting of Elements:
Use elements in other elements
For fully functionality we add some attributes to make it interactive.

Syntax: class = "..." (attributes name then its value)
inside a quotaion mark we write attributes name "btn"

Some boolean attributes like "required" like when creating a form there should filing gmail compulsory.

General purpose of attributes:
<a id = "value">
<span id = "value">
<img src = "value">

1. ID:
We give it only one element mean particular 
it should be a unique.

2. Class:
This is not a unique we give it for more then one element and can give a value randomly.

Now to use and create html page: (Boiler plate code) -> first code

!DOCTYPE html:
Tell browser that which type of document -> HTML

<html>
This is the root element all the components include inside this tag
</html>

<head>
Basicly the info that do not display on web like
but related to web like (title) and (links) etc.
Also a colletion of metadata
</head>

<body>
All the things we need to display it on web browser.
</body>

2. i: for italic
3. small: for small text.
4. supscript (sup): for 10 power 2. (10 <sup>2</sup>)
