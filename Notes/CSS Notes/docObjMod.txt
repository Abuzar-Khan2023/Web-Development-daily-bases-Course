How CSS Works?
Ans:
    Every browser when display any website first arrived 2 docs of html and css.

First HTML arrived to browser they convert it into DOM.
Then dom shift to memory of computer and they fetch css with html and its all content like audio, img, videos.
JavaScript load in last.

Now What is DOM?
Ans:
    Dom is tree structure like parents -> child ~ there siblings and so on...


Units in CSS:

1. Reletive: (Dependent on other like on size and or parent)
%, em, rem, vh, vw, vmin, vmax

%: It will be calculate from parent tag like form body
    if body have 50px font-size and another div have 200% 
    so the it will compare like 200% of 50px.

em:
    It will compare with current font-size of the elements.

rem:
    Compare or reletive with root element mean the root is <html>

vw:
    Compare or calculate with browser width mean 1% of the width of the viewport.

vh:
    Also Compare or calculate with browser but height mean 1% of the height of the viewport

vmin:
    It will compare the height and width and then select minimun of them.

vmax:
    It will compare the height and width but it will select maximun of them.



2. Absolute: (Fixed values)
cm, mm, px, pt, pc
