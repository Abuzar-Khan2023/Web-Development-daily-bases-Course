There are three way to import css for HTML:

1. Inline:      We write a css code inside the <style> tag in html file.
2. External:    For that we ceate another file for css and then linked to its html.
3. Internal:    Use a <style> tag in a line of html for a spacific html tag.

For all three there is example available in CSS-first file.

Selector In CSS:

1.  Type Selector:           h1 {}              Here h1 is tag from html file
2.  Universal Selector:      * {}               This selector is applying for all html file
3.  Class Selector:          .box {}            Here box is the class name we give them in html file and represented by .
4.  ID Selector:             #box {}            Here box is ID name and # represent it.
5.  Attribute Selector:      a[title] {}        Here we select a particular url       
6.  Pseudo Class Selector:   p:first-chile {}   Group of selector we style different state of elements => use in :hover when we select it its change there is state. 
7.  Pseudo Element Selector: p::first-line {}   Like here we want to desgin the first line of paragraph.
8.  Descendant Combinator:   article p          Select elements with his chile mean inside tags within one tag
9.  Chiled Combinator:       article > p
